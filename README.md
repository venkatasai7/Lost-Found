# Django Project README

This repository contains a Django project for managing posts and user authentication.
I crafted a full-stack Django application for lost and found items, encompassing user profiles and posts. Users, equipped with the ability to create multiple posts, can seamlessly share images and location information. The user-friendly interface displays four posts per page, streamlining the lost-and-found experience with seamless image uploads and detailed information for efficient item recovery.

- **django_project/**: Main project directory.
