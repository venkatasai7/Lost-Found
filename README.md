I crafted a full-stack Django application for lost and found items, encompassing user profiles and posts. Users, equipped with the ability to create multiple posts, can seamlessly share images and location information.The user-friendly interface displays four posts per page, streamlining the lost-and-found experience with seamless image uploads and detailed information for efficient item recovery.![image](https://github.com/venkatasai7/Lost-Found/assets/87575630/fd8f91b4-f7bc-429e-a797-a1e71181b10d)
