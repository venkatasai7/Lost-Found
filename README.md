I crafted a full-stack Django application for lost and found items, encompassing user profiles and posts. Users, equipped with the ability to create multiple posts, can seamlessly share images and location information.The user-friendly interface displays four posts per page, streamlining the lost-and-found experience with seamless image uploads and detailed information for efficient item recovery.
